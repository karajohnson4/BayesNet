We use a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model with gamma-distributed waiting times in the E and I states and an exponential time to transmission over an S-I edge. This requires estimation or specification of twelve parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\beta_i$: the exponential rate of transmission during each infectious phase
\item $k_w, \theta_w$: the gamma shape and scale parameters that determine distribution of the length of each infectious phase
\end{itemize}
