The transmission network $\Pnet$ is induced by epidemic spread over that network. 

The transmission network is stochastically determined by the contact network and epidemic transition times. Each infected person (aside from the earliest infection) contributes one edge to the transmission network. First, the set of possible infectors for each person infected is determined. Potential infectors include all people who have entered the infectious phase and have not yet been removed at the time of infection of the infectee. The infector is then sampled from this set with probability proportional to the duration of time between when the potential infector became infectious and when the infection occurred. The edge between the selected infector and the infectee is then added to the transmission network.
