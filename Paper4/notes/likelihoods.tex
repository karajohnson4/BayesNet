\textbf{Compartments}

\begin{itemize}
    \item SIR model with infection broken down into different phases of infection
    \item Left E out, time is negligible compared to timescale of rest of model compartments
    \item Literature review, consensus model with 4 stages
    \item Varied a lot in terms of what the compartments were, 4 stages common
    \item Model flexible, can label 4 stages of infection based on setting, such as defining stages by clinical symptoms, or viral load
    \item People are susceptible if in the risk population
    \item Move to infected if they become HIV pos by coming into contact with someone who is infected
    \item Progress through different stages of infection and removed as long as they are not on treatment
    \item Can move in and out of treatment for each stage, but assuming they do not progress in the disease course if they achieve viral suppression on treatment
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Likelihoods}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Likelihood of time of removal (i.e. death), given data on transmission rates, time on treatment, time of infection, etc.
    \item In line with what has been done previously, as Ravi described
    \item Modifies the likelihoods to account for the 4 stages of infection
    \item Takes into account contributions of contacts where infection was transmitted, and not transmitted, transition to each infectious phase and removal
    \item Likelihood a product of all of these
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Contacts}

\begin{itemize}
    \item First two contributions from contact pairs where infection was ultimately transmitted (L1) and not (L2)
    \item Both formulas follow an exponential distribution, for time the infected partner could have transmitted to the susceptible partner
    \item Takes into account time the infected partner spent in each stage of infection, where each stage has a different rate of transmission (how likely for each phase) - betas
    \item Infection rate higher when in acute stage, and AIDS stage
    \item How often infection happens for each compartment
    \item Also subtracts out time infected partner spends on treatment, since assuming cannot contribute to transmission during
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Transitions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Time spent in each infection phase for every person who is ultimately infected
    \item Coming from exposures that are in the acute, chronic, late, AIDS stage
    \item Follows a gamma distribution where thetas and kappas (shape and scale) capture the rate of flow into each compartment
\end{itemize}
